title: Overall Architecture
description: 'The architecture of asimplevectors is designed with performance, scalability, and reliability in mind, combining modern technologies to manage and serve vector data efficiently.'
---

## Basic Architecture

The REST server is implemented in Rust, ensuring high stability and performance. For clustering, the Raft consensus protocol has been adopted. Raft is a simple yet powerful consensus algorithm that enhances the system's availability and reliability.

The [`asimplevectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors) project leverages the [`atinyvectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/atinyvectors) library, which is implemented in C++. The [`atinyvectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/atinyvectors) library uses SQLite3, providing reliable and convenient data management. Additionally, the system supports RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), making administration and management straightforward.

## Dependencies

The system requires the following dependencies to function properly:

- **Rust**: The core of the REST server and clustering logic is built using Rust for its performance and reliability.
- **CMake**: Required for building the C++ components, including the [`atinyvectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/atinyvectors) library.
- **OpenRaft**: Used for implementing the Raft consensus protocol, which ensures reliable clustering and data consistency.
- **HNSWLib**: A library for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search, improving the performance of vector similarity queries.
- **SQLite3**: Integrated into the [`atinyvectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/atinyvectors) library to provide lightweight, reliable data management.
- **RocksDB**: A high-performance key-value storage used for managing original document data and vector storage efficiently.
- **OpenSSL**: Ensures secure communication within the system, especially for the REST API and data transfer.
- **Docker**: Facilitates the containerization of the system, ensuring consistent environments and easy deployment across different platforms.
