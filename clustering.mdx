title: 'Clustering'
---

The **asimplevectors** system utilizes Raft-based clustering to ensure high availability and reliability across distributed nodes. Clustering allows multiple nodes to work together seamlessly, with the Raft consensus protocol ensuring consistency and fault tolerance. The leader node manages write operations, while follower nodes replicate data to maintain data integrity. This clustering setup ensures that even if some nodes fail, the system can continue operating with minimal disruption, making **asimplevectors** highly robust for large-scale deployments.


## Clustering

1. Start Leader Node
```bash
docker build --build-arg BUILD_TYPE=Release -t asimplevectors .
docker run -p 21001:21001 -p 21002:21002 asimplevectors --id 1 &
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/init" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```
2. Start Follower nodes
```bash
docker run -p 22001:21001 -p 22002:21002 asimplevectors --id 2 &
docker run -p 23001:21001 -p 23002:21002 asimplevectors --id 3 &
```
3. Register new cluster
```bash
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/add-learner" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[2, "127.0.0.1:22001", "127.0.0.1:22002"]'
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/add-learner" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[3, "127.0.0.1:23001", "127.0.0.1:23001"]'
```
4. Test
```bash
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/metrics"
```
This adds a clear note about Raft's recommendation for an odd number of nodes but also specifies that two nodes will still work.

## Change Membership

If you want to remove or change membership then try membership api
```bash
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/change-membership" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[1, 2, 3]'
```

## Troubleshooting

When working with a Raft consensus cluster in **asimplevectors**, certain issues can arise due to the nature of how Raft handles leadership and write commands. Below are common problems and how to resolve them:

### Issue: Write Command Sent to Follower Node

In a Raft cluster, all **write commands must be sent to the leader node** for optimal performance. If a write command is mistakenly sent to a follower node, the system will return an error indicating that the node is not the leader.

#### Solution:
- Use the **metrics API** to identify the current leader in the cluster.  
- Once the leader is identified, resend the write command to the leader node to ensure successful execution.
