## Supported Metrics: L2, Cosine, InnerProduct
`asimplevectors` supports multiple distance metrics to handle a variety of use cases, offering flexibility in how vectors are compared.
- **L2 Distance (Euclidean Distance)**: Useful for scenarios where the absolute difference between vectors matters. It is widely used in scenarios like image retrieval where geometric proximity between vectors is essential.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Ideal for applications where the angle between vectors is important, such as in document similarity tasks. This metric is normalized and measures how similar vectors are, regardless of their magnitude.
- **Inner Product (Dot Product)**: Commonly used for ranking and recommendation systems, the Inner Product focuses on maximizing the relevance score between vectors. It works best when vector magnitudes carry meaningful weight.
