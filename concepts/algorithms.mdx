## Overview

In `asimplevectors`, we leverage the **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)** algorithm to efficiently manage and search through vector databases. HNSW is known for its speed and accuracy in approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, which makes it an ideal algorithm for high-performance vector databases.

We utilize the open-source [**hnswlib**](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) library, which provides a robust implementation of the HNSW algorithm. By tuning the parameters of HNSW, we are able to balance between performance and accuracy, depending on the needs of specific applications.

## HNSW Algorithm

The HNSW algorithm is designed to build and search a graph structure where vectors are connected based on proximity. The graph is hierarchical, meaning that at higher levels, vectors are connected sparsely, and at lower levels, the connections are denser. This structure allows for efficient search times, as vectors can be located quickly by moving through the graph levels.

### Key Advantages of HNSW:
1. **Fast Search Times**: The hierarchical nature allows for logarithmic search complexity in most cases.
2. **Scalability**: HNSW scales well with large datasets, making it suitable for databases with millions of vectors.
3. **Dynamic Updates**: It allows for dynamic insertion and deletion of vectors without needing to rebuild the entire structure.

## HNSW Parameters

HNSW uses three important parameters that control the behavior of the algorithm. For more details on how to configure these parameters, please refer to the [Get Started/Configuration](/getstarted/configuration) page.

### 1. M (Max Connections)
**M** controls the maximum number of outgoing connections (edges) for each node in the graph. Higher values of **M** lead to better accuracy but increase memory usage and computational cost during both the construction and search phases.

- **Default value**: M = 16
- **Effect**: Increasing **M** improves search accuracy but also increases the memory footprint and processing time.

### 2. EF (Size of Dynamic List during Search)
**EF** is the size of the dynamic list used during the search process. This parameter controls how many neighboring nodes the algorithm explores when searching for the nearest neighbor. A higher **EF** value improves search accuracy but slows down the search process.

- **Default value**: EF = 100
- **Effect**: Increasing **EF** improves search recall and accuracy but decreases search speed.

### 3. EFConstruction (Size of Dynamic List during Index Construction)
**EFConstruction** controls the number of candidate neighbors considered during the construction of the graph. A higher value of **EFConstruction** leads to a more accurate graph but requires more time and computational resources to build.

- **Default value**: EFConstruction = 100
- **Effect**: Increasing **EFConstruction** improves the accuracy of the index but increases the time and computational cost to build it.

## Performance vs. Accuracy

The default parameter settings for HNSW in `asimplevectors` are:

- **M**: 16
- **EF**: 100
- **EFConstruction**: 100

These defaults provide a good balance between speed and accuracy. However, tuning these values can affect both performance and accuracy:

- **Increasing the values of M, EF, or EFConstruction** will result in better search accuracy and recall at the cost of slower performance and higher memory usage.
- **Decreasing these values** can speed up the search process but may reduce the accuracy of the search results.

By adjusting these parameters, you can optimize the behavior of the vector database for different types of workloads, depending on whether speed or accuracy is the priority.

## Summary

In `asimplevectors`, we effectively use the HNSW algorithm via the open-source [**hnswlib**](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) library. The three key parameters—**M**, **EF**, and **EFConstruction**—play a critical role in determining the trade-offs between search accuracy and performance. While the default values offer a balanced setup, tuning these parameters allows for more control over the system’s behavior, depending on specific application needs.
