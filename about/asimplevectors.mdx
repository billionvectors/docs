- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: In RAG, vector databases play a key role by allowing retrieval of relevant documents or data based on vector similarity, which is then used to augment generative models like large language models (LLMs). This significantly improves the quality of the generated output by providing contextually relevant information.
- **Recommendation Systems**: By comparing user interaction data or product features in vector space, vector databases can provide fast and accurate recommendations for items such as movies, products, or music.
- **Semantic Search**: Vector databases enable more meaningful search results by representing text as vectors. This allows for searches based on the intent or meaning of the query, rather than just keyword matching.
- **Image and Video Search**: By storing visual data as vectors, the system allows for similarity-based searches of images or videos. This can be used in applications like facial recognition or finding visually similar products.

## Key Advantages

- **Optimized for RAG**: Built to handle RAG tasks efficiently.
- **Fast and Reliable Clustering**: Uses Rust and the Raft consensus protocol to deliver a highly performant clustering system.
- **Easy Data Management**: Utilizes SQLite3 for simple and effective data organization.
- **Integrated Key-Value Storage**: Manage original document data alongside vectors with the built-in key-value store.

## Features

- **Version Management**: Includes support for version control, with A/B testing capabilities.
- **Key-Value Storage**: Built-in key-value storage functionality.
- **Snapshot Support**: Offers snapshot capabilities for data backups and state saving.
- **Dense & Sparse Vector Management**: Handles both dense and sparse vector types.

### Supported Metrics: L2, Cosine, InnerProduct
`asimplevectors` supports multiple distance metrics to handle a variety of use cases, offering flexibility in how vectors are compared.
- **L2 Distance (Euclidean Distance)**: Useful for scenarios where the absolute difference between vectors matters. It is widely used in scenarios like image retrieval where geometric proximity between vectors is essential.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Ideal for applications where the angle between vectors is important, such as in document similarity tasks. This metric is normalized and measures how similar vectors are, regardless of their magnitude.
- **Inner Product (Dot Product)**: Commonly used for ranking and recommendation systems, the Inner Product focuses on maximizing the relevance score between vectors. It works best when vector magnitudes carry meaningful weight.
