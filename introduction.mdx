title: Introduction
description: 'asimplevectors is a high-performance vector database optimized for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It provides fast and reliable clustering through Rust and the Raft consensus protocol, while leveraging SQLite3 for easy data management. Additionally, the database includes built-in key-value storage for managing original document data within the vector database.'

## Use Cases of Vector Database

A vector database is designed to efficiently handle and manage high-dimensional vector data, making it an essential tool in various domains. Below are some key use cases:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: In RAG, vector databases play a key role by allowing retrieval of relevant documents or data based on vector similarity, which is then used to augment generative models like large language models (LLMs). This significantly improves the quality of the generated output by providing contextually relevant information.
- **Recommendation Systems**: By comparing user interaction data or product features in vector space, vector databases can provide fast and accurate recommendations for items such as movies, products, or music.
- **Semantic Search**: Vector databases enable more meaningful search results by representing text as vectors. This allows for searches based on the intent or meaning of the query, rather than just keyword matching.
- **Image and Video Search**: By storing visual data as vectors, the system allows for similarity-based searches of images or videos. This can be used in applications like facial recognition or finding visually similar products.

## Key Advantages

- **Optimized for RAG**: Built to handle RAG tasks efficiently.
- **Fast and Reliable Clustering**: Uses Rust and the Raft consensus protocol to deliver a highly performant clustering system.
- **Easy Data Management**: Utilizes SQLite3 for simple and effective data organization.
- **Integrated Key-Value Storage**: Manage original document data alongside vectors with the built-in key-value store.

## Features

- **Version Management**: Includes support for version control, with A/B testing capabilities.
- **Key-Value Storage**: Built-in key-value storage functionality.
- **Snapshot Support**: Offers snapshot capabilities for data backups and state saving.
- **Dense & Sparse Vector Management**: Handles both dense and sparse vector types.
- **Multi-Vector Support**: In-progress support for managing multiple vector types (WIP).
