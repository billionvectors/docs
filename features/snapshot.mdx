title: 'Snapshot'

## Overview

In [`asimplevectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors), a **snapshot** is a full replication of all **spaces**, including the index, database (DB), and key-value storage. This feature allows you to capture the entire state of your vector database at a specific point in time, providing a backup for restoration and other uses.

### Snapshot Process

- When a snapshot is requested, it replicates the index, database, and key-value store of all Spaces.
- **Snapshot creation** can take 20 minutes or longer, as all nodes in the system generate the snapshot simultaneously.
- The snapshot is stored in a **zip** format and includes an **SQLite3 database**.

### Modifying the SQLite3 DB

While it is possible to directly modify the SQLite3 database within a snapshot, it is **not recommended**. Direct modifications may affect the integrity of the database, and it is preferable to manage data using the provided API.

## Snapshot Endpoints

### Creating a Snapshot

To create a snapshot of all Spaces, use the `/api/snapshot` endpoint. You can also force the inclusion of a specific Space's index by specifying the following JSON option. This will force a dump of the Space's index and replicate it, speeding up the restoration process.

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/snapshot" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
    "spacename": 1
}'
```
### Checking Available Snapshots
To view a list of all available snapshots, use the `/api/snapshots` endpoint:
```
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/snapshots"
```
### Downloading a Snapshot
To download a specific snapshot, use the following endpoint, replacing `{snapshot-date}` with the date of the snapshot you wish to download:
```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/snapshot/20241002101000/download"
```
### Restoring from a Snapshot
To restore a snapshot, use the following endpoint, replacing `{snapshot-date}` with the date of the snapshot you wish to restore:
```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/snapshot/{snapshot-date}/restore" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
{
}
```

## Summary

Snapshots in `asimplevectors` allow you to fully back up and restore Spaces, including their index, DB, and key-value data. This ensures that you can recover or replicate the state of your vector database at any point in time. While you can modify the SQLite3 database within a snapshot, it's generally recommended to avoid direct changes to maintain the system's integrity.

```bash
./run_example.sh snapshot
```
