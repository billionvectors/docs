In [`asimplevectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors), **Space** refers to a **Vector Space**. When you create a Space, several components are automatically generated, including the default version, data storage, a database (DB), an HNSW index, and a key-value database.

For more detailed information on the data structure, please refer to the [About us/Concepts/Data Structures](/architecture/datastructure) page.

## Creating a Space

To create a new Space, you can use the `/api/space` endpoint. Below is an example where a Space called `spacename` is created with a default index configuration. The **dimension** is set to 4, and the **metric** is set to **L2** (Euclidean distance).

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
'{
    "name": "spacename",
    "dimension": 4,
    "metric": "L2"
}'
```

## Checking Created Space Information

Once a Space is created, you can check its details by using the /api/space/{spacename} endpoint.

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename"
```

## Adding Vectors to the Space

To add vectors to the created Space, you can use the /api/space/{spacename}/vector endpoint. Below is an example where several vectors are added to the spacename Space, each with its own ID, vector data, and metadata.

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/vector" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d   \
'{
    "vectors": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "data": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
            "metadata": {"label": "first"}
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "data": [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8],
            "metadata": {"label": "second"}
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "data": [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6],
            "metadata": {"label": "third"}
        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "data": [1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
            "metadata": {"label": "forth"}
        },
        {
            "id": 5,
            "data": [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3],
            "metadata": {"label": "fivth"}
        }
    ]
}'
```

This command will add multiple vectors to the Space, allowing you to store and retrieve vector data efficiently.
