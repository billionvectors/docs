title: 'Access Control'
---

## Overview

In [`asimplevectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors), we support **Rule-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure secure access to different parts of the system. For more details on how the rules work, please refer to the [concepts/accesscontrol](/concepts/accesscontrol) page.

By default, access control is disabled. To enable access control, you need to set the `ATV_ENABLE_SECURITY` key to `1` in your `.env` file:

```bash .env
ATV_ENABLE_SECURITY=1
```
Once access control is enabled, you can define permissions for different system components by creating access tokens.

## Token Generation
To generate a token with read/write (rw) permissions for the system, space, version, vector, and snapshot components, use the `/api/security/tokens` endpoint and provide the following JSON data:
```
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/security/tokens" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
    "system": 2,
    "space": 2,
    "version": 2,
    "vector": 2,
    "snapshot": 2
}'
```
* system, space, version, vector, snapshot: Permission levels where 2 indicates read/write access.

## Using the Token
After generating a token, you must include it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token when making API requests. Below is an example of how to use a token when accessing the `/api/space` endpoint:

### Example: Accessing /api/space with a Bearer Token
```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space" -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```
Replace `{token}` with the actual token string you received during token generation.

## Listing All Tokens
To view a list of all tokens that have been issued, you can use the following endpoint:
```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/security/tokens"
```
## Summary
By enabling access control, [`asimplevectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors) allows you to manage permissions across various system components, ensuring secure access. Tokens are generated with specific read/write permissions for different parts of the system, and they must be included in the Authorization header when making API requests.

```bash
./run_example.sh security
```
