## Overview

In [`asimplevectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors), vectors can be inserted or updated using the **upsert** mechanism. Upsert is a combination of "update" and "insert," which means that if a vector with a specific ID already exists, it will be updated with the new data. If the vector does not exist, it will be inserted as a new entry.

## Upserting Vectors

To upsert vectors into a specific Space, you can use the `/api/space/{spacename}/vector` endpoint. Below is an example where several dense vectors are upserted with their respective IDs, data, and metadata.

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/vector" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
'{
    "vectors": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "data": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
            "metadata": {"label": "first"}
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "data": [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8],
            "metadata": {"label": "second"}
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "data": [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6],
            "metadata": {"label": "third"}
        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "data": [1.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
            "metadata": {"label": "forth"}
        },
        {
            "id": 5,
            "data": [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3],
            "metadata": {"label": "fivth"}
        }
    ]
}'
```
In this case, if any of the vectors (e.g., with ID 1, 2, etc.) already exist, they will be updated. Otherwise, they will be added as new vectors.

## Metadata

Each vector can have associated metadata, which can be specified in the \"metadata\": \{\"key\": \"value\"\} format. This allows additional information to be stored with the vectors. For example:

```bash
{
    "id": 1,
    "data": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
    "metadata": {"label": "first"}
}
```
This metadata can be useful for tagging or categorizing vectors for later retrieval or analysis.

## Sparse Vectors

In asimplevectors, vectors can be stored in either dense or sparse format. To insert sparse vectors, you need to create a sparse vector Space. Below is an example of how to create a Space specifically for sparse vectors:

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
{
    "name": "spacename",        
    "sparse": {
        "metric": "Cosine"
    }
}
```
Once the sparse vector Space is created, you can upsert sparse vectors using the following format:
```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/vector" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
'{
    "vectors": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "sparse_data": {
                "indices": [0, 2],
                "values": [0.5, 0.8]
            },
            "metadata": {"category": "C"}
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "sparse_data": {
                "indices": [1, 3],
                "values": [0.9, 1.0]
            },
            "metadata": {"category": "D"}
        }
    ]
}'
```
In this case, sparse vectors are represented using sparse_data, which includes `indices` and `values`. The `indices` represent the positions in the vector, and the `values` represent the non-zero values at those positions.
