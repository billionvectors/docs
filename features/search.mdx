## Overview

In [`asimplevectors`](https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors), you can perform searches on both dense and sparse vectors within a specified Space. The search operation allows you to query the vector database and retrieve the most similar vectors based on the specified input vector.

## Search Endpoint

The search endpoint for a specific Space is:

`/api/space/{spacename}/search`

### Searching with Dense Vectors

To search using a dense vector, you can use the following JSON format. This will query the database with the given vector and return the most similar vectors.

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/search" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
'{
    "vector": [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3]
}'
```

###  Searching with Sparse Vectors

To search using a sparse vector, the following JSON format should be used. The vector is represented by its sparse data, which includes the indices and corresponding values.

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/search" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
'{
    "vector": { 
        "sparse_data": {
            "indices": [1, 3],
            "values": [0.9, 1.0]
        } 
    }
}'
```

## Metadata-Filtered Search

As of the current version (0.1.0), metadata-filtered search is a work-in-progress. Future releases will support the ability to filter search results based on metadata associated with vectors.

For more detailed examples, please refer [https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors/example](https://github.com/billionvectors/asimplevectors/tree/main/example)

```bash
./run_example.sh search
```
