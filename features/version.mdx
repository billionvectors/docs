## Why Versioning is Needed

In a vector database, versioning is crucial for several reasons:

- **Model Changes**: Unlike traditional relational databases, when embedding models change, there is often a need to migrate all the data. Keeping track of versions allows for smoother transitions between different embedding models.
- **A/B Testing**: Data versioning makes it easier to manage multiple versions of the same dataset, allowing for effective A/B testing.
- **Ease of Management**: Introducing versions simplifies the management of data, ensuring that older versions are still accessible, and new versions can be created without disrupting ongoing processes.

## Creating a Version

To create a version, use the `/api/space/{spacename}/version` endpoint by passing the following JSON object:

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/version" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
'{
    "name": "version1",
    "description": "Initial version",
    "tag": "v1.0",
    "is_default": true
}'
```
* name: The name of the version (e.g., version1).
* description: A brief description of the version (e.g., Initial version).
* tag: A version tag (e.g., v1.0).
* is_default: A boolean that sets whether this is the default version.

## Retrieving Version Information

### Get Default Version

To retrieve information about the default version, use the following endpoint:

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/version/default"
```

### Get Version by Name

To get version information by specifying its name, use this endpoint:

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/version/{versionname}/by-name"
```

### List All Versions

To retrieve a list of all versions for a specific space, use the following endpoint:

```bash
curl "127.0.0.1:21001/api/space/spacename/version/list"
```

By keeping track of different versions, it becomes easier to maintain a clean, organized structure for managing vector data across different iterations, testing environments, and models.
