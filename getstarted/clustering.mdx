Clustering in `asimplevectors` is built using a distributed architecture with support for Raft consensus. This ensures reliable and consistent clustering across nodes in a high-performance environment.

## Setup Instructions

You can follow these steps to build and run the cluster:

```bash
docker build --build-arg BUILD_TYPE=Release -t asimplevectors .
docker run -p 21001:21001 -p 21002:21002 asimplevectors --id 1 &
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/init" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

docker run -p 22001:21001 -p 22002:21002 asimplevectors --id 2 &
docker run -p 23001:21001 -p 23002:21002 asimplevectors --id 3 &
```

This will initialize a cluster with three nodes. The first node (id 1) is set as the leader.

## Registering New Nodes
To add additional nodes (learners) to the cluster, you can register them as follows:
```bash
# register new cluster nodes
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/add-learner" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[2, "127.0.0.1:22001", "127.0.0.1:22002"]'
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/add-learner" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[3, "127.0.0.1:23001", "127.0.0.1:23001"]'
```
Once the nodes have been added, you can retrieve cluster metrics to verify their status:
```bash
curl --silent "127.0.0.1:21001/cluster/metrics"
```
## Node Recommendations

It is recommended by the Raft consensus protocol to have an odd number of nodes (e.g., 3, 5, etc.) to prevent split-brain scenarios and ensure quorum is met in case of node failure. However, it is possible to run the cluster with just two nodes if needed, although this setup may be more prone to availability issues.
